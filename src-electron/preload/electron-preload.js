/**
 * This file is used specifically for security reasons.

 * WARNING!
 * If you import anything from node_modules, then make sure that the package is specified
 * in package.json > dependencies and NOT in devDependencies
 *
 * Example (injects window.myAPI.doAThing() into renderer thread):
 *
 *   import { contextBridge } from 'electron'
 *
 *   contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('myAPI', {
 *     doAThing: () => {}
